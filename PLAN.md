# Rough Plan for ACNH Companion
## Project Description
- Started on 7/16/25
- Idea: create a data-driven web application where users can use some kind of dashboard to track bugs, fossils, and fish that they have collected; implement a recommender system where users can input their style preference for furniture or clothes and get shopping recommendations
- Future ideas: Stalk Market turnip price prediction, user login

## Project Phases
# Phase 1: Data Collection/Cleaning
- will be using data from Nookipedia, largest online encyclopedia for all things Animal Crossing
- decide whether using api or webscraping (probably webscraping)
- scrape data, get into usable formate (tables/dicts)
Date completed: 8/14/25

# Phase 2: Create Check-Off Style Dashboard in frontend
- pick a UI designer (react!!)
- routes from tables in backend to frontend
- clean up a little? ui? (not quite sure yet how frontend completely works)
Date completed: 
BONUSES:
- progress bar for each
- list of all awards thay can get for fossil/fish/bugs

# Phase 3: Shopping Recommender
- create a recommender system based on cosine similarity between a furniture/piece of clothing's style and the user's personal preferences
- should be fine
Date completed:

# Phase 4: Recommender page in frontend
- routes from recommeder function in backend to frontend
- hopefully easier after doing in phase 2
