# Rough Plan for ACNH Companion
## Project Description
- Started on 7/16/25
- Idea: create a data-driven web application where users can use some kind of dashboard to track bugs, fossils, and fish that they have collected; implement a recommender system where users can input their style preference for furniture or clothes and get shopping recommendations
- Future ideas: Stalk Market turnip price prediction, user login

## Project Phases
# Phase 1: Data Collection/Cleaning
- will be using data from Nookipedia, largest online encyclopedia for all things Animal Crossing
- decide whether using api or webscraping (probably webscraping)
- scrape data, get into usable formate (tables/csv)

# Phase 2: Create Check-Off Style Dashboard
- pick a UI designer (react!!)
